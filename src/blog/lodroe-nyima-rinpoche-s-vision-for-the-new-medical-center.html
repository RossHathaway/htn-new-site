                                        would like that to become?</em

                                The nunnery is already existent there, so the
                                hope is that after the nuns have dwelled in the
                                nunnery, the next step would be for them to
                                study medicine so that they will not only be
                                able to help themselves, but will also be able
                                to medically help the nomads in that area.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the nuns at the nunnery come from nomad
                                families and for that reason they do not really
                                know how to take care of themselves in terms of
                                healthcare; maintaining good health is very,
                                very lacking among them. It is my hope that with
                                the establishment of a Medical Center, that they
                                could learn more about this, especially because
                                a lot of the nomad women have feminine diseases
                                and it all comes from the fact that they are
                                lacking in even the most basic knowledge about
                                how to maintain good health.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When they get sick they do not really like to go
                                to the doctor, for obvious reasons, and they
                                wait until they cannot stand it any longer and
                                only then will they go to the hospital, so it
                                becomes a widespread problem in the nomadic
                                areas. Therefore, I would like the nuns to learn
                                not just general healthcare but feminine health
                                care, so that they can help other women–not only
                                nuns but the local nomad women too.

                                        during childbirth?</em

                                Yes there are a lot of childbirth-related deaths
                                (either the mother or the child), because they
                                do not go to the hospital for childbirth; they
                                do it at home, so there is a lot of danger
                                involved. And after childbirth the mother does
                                not really know how to take care of herself so a
                                lot of problems ensue, therefore it is good for
                                the nuns to study medicine to learn how to take
                                care of other women.
                            </p>

                                Traditionally in Tibet there is discrimination
                                against women. For example, if offerings are
                                made to the monastery, they are usually only
                                made to the monks but not to the nuns. Therefore
                                I have encouraged the nuns to keep their
                                dwellings clean, and to be diligent in their
                                study and practice so that they can prove to
                                others that they are, if not better, then at
                                least equal to the monks. And they have followed
                                my advice and have really touched the minds of
                                the local people. They have impressed the local
                                people. For example, the local residents have
                                been surprised to find that nuns can also chant
                                Mahakala. They used to think that only the monks
                                could chant Mahakala.

                                And traditionally, when there were difficulties
                                in the families, they would only ask the monks
                                to do prayers and pujas for them but would never
                                ask the nuns. In recent years there has been a
                                lot of economic development in the area where
                                Thrangu Monastery is, which is Yushu–(and along
                                with that development there is also a lot of
                                death)—so many people are asking the monks to do
                                prayers and pujas for them. But the monks are
                                sometimes too busy.

                                On the other hand, the nuns are just sitting
                                there; they have a lot of time but are not being
                                asked. So I said to the nuns, “Don’t be
                                discouraged. This is a condition that has arisen
                                because of our cultural background and if you
                                want to become equal with the monks, you must
                                study and do what the men do. Then your social
                                status will improve along with that. So through
                                study, contemplation and meditation things will
                                improve for you and also if you study medicine
                                you will be able to help people in the area and
                                by that, through your own study, contemplation,
                                meditation, plus medical knowledge, you will
                                change the concepts people have about nuns and
                                about females in general. So you cannot just
                                talk and say, ‘We want equality, we want this,’
                                you actually have to prove to them that you are
                                equal.”

                                For example now there are two retreat facilities
                                in the nunnery. One is the Six Dharmas of Naropa
                                retreat, and the other retreat is for Guru
                                Rinpoche practice, Akshobhya, Vairocana and so
                                on. And the locals were surprised. They said,
                                “Wow, even the Anis can do [advanced] practices
                                such as the Six Dharmas!”

                                Yes. There is already a small medical center in
                                the monk’s monastery that was funded by the
                                Human Rights Foundation in Beijing. They are
                                still building it and it is not furnished yet,
                                but my hope is that there will be separate
                                medical centers–that the monks will have their
                                own and the nuns will have their own and will
                                take care of feminine health problems.

                                My plan is for the nuns to study mainly Tibetan
                                medicine, and Chinese medicine and acupuncture,
                                with only a little bit of Western medicine. The
                                main reason being that Western medicine takes
                                many years to study and is very intense and
                                involved, plus the medicines prescribed would be
                                extremely expensive and unaffordable to the
                                locals there. So my hope is for the nuns to
                                study Tibetan medicine and make their own herbal
                                pills because it is a very pristine environment
                                and the herbs that that are necessary grow
                                naturally there, so they can harvest those herbs
                                to make the pills. That way the medicine will be
                                affordable to the local people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And as for Chinese medicine, it will be mainly
                                acupuncture and traditional Chinese herbs plus
                                massage techniques. I would like them to learn
                                that because the Tibetans now take painkillers
                                whenever they have a problem, whether it be a
                                headache or knee problem–anything. They do not
                                really take proper medication, and I would like
                                to see them taken care of properly with the
                                right kind of medicine rather than just rely on
                                Western painkillers.

                                My vision is to build a large medical facility
                                at the outset rather than starting small and
                                adding onto it because it would be more costly
                                that way. So even if it takes longer to get all
                                the funds together, I would rather do that–wait
                                a few years until all the funds have been
                                gathered and then build it all at once, on a
                                large scale. That includes facilities for drying
                                the herbs, because after gathering the herbs,
                                you need to make them into herbal pills and they
                                need to be dried. So there must be a clean
                                facility where there is no dust. We need a
                                good-sized facility for that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another thought is for the nuns to make Tibetan
                                incense, since they will be gathering herbs, so
                                they can sell incense and use the proceeds to
                                fund themselves. So all of these things, the
                                herbal medicines, the medical treatment, and the
                                incense will help to fund the nunnery.

                                There have been already two nuns in the past
                                studying Tibetan medicine and now there is a
                                third who has begun to study as well.

                                Initially my plan did not include a facility
                                that would manufacture Tibetan medicine so it
                                was smaller scale, but now after talking to some
                                Tibetan doctors, I began to think it would be
                                nice for the nunnery to make their own medicines
                                onsite. Further, I found by talking to the
                                doctors that there are certain procedures and a
                                certain environment that you need in order to
                                facilitate that, and that includes a room that
                                is completely free from any dust. And people who
                                are handling the herbs need to be very sterile
                                and clean and all that. There will be a room for
                                selecting the herbs and a room for processing
                                the herbs and a room for drying the herbs, so it
                                becomes more involved, thus at this point I do
                                not know how large it will need to be but no
                                matter how small it might be, it still needs to
                                have certain rooms for these various functions.
                                I will have to talk to more doctors to find out
                                more about the actual requirements and the scale
                                of the building and then after that we can come
                                up with a finalized budget.

                                The rough plan in my mind is for a three-story
                                building: the top floor would be for drying the
                                herbs, the second floor would be for making the
                                pills and the first floor would be a clinic for
                                people to come in and receive medical treatment.
                                As I said, some of the nuns have already been
                                receiving medical training and in order to get
                                some volunteer teachers, I posted a request on
                                the equivalent of Facebook in China. They do not
                                have Facebook but something similar, so I posted
                                there asking for female medical volunteers and
                                after that a few people have come from Beijing
                                to help and they are pretty good. So there are
                                now a few volunteers teaching the nuns both
                                Chinese language and Chinese medicine and
                                especially feminine health care and hygiene and
                                that will be very helpful to them.

title: Thrangu Nunnery in Tibet is Building a Medical Center
subtitle: ''
description:
    Thrangu nunnery, under the direction of Lodroe Nyima Rinpoche, is currently
    looking at ways to become self-sustaining while simultaneously supplying some of
    the crucial needs of the local community, which like the nunnery is very poor. They
    have determined that a medical center would best serve the needs of the area. There
    is currently no such facility.

HelpTibetanNuns.org is a is a non-profit organization created by U.S. supporters of Thrangu Kong Jo Sherab Ling Nunnery, an affiliate of Thrangu Monastery in Kham, Eastern Tibet. This thriving Buddhist community houses over 100 nuns in Yushu, Qinghai Province, near the town of Jiegu. This area was hit by a major earthquake in 2010, killing approximately 2,700 people.

Resting on the Tibetan Plateau some 12,000 feet above sea level, the nunnery consists of a temple, a three-year-retreat building, and living facilities for the nuns. The nunnery is in a very remote area and the nuns are poor and currently have no source of income other than what they are able to obtain by begging.

The nunnery, under the direction of Lodroe Nyima Rinpoche, is currently looking at ways to become self-sustaining while simultaneously supplying some of the crucial needs of the local community, which like the nunnery is very poor. They have determined that a medical center would best serve the needs of the area. There is currently no such facility.

The nunnery has already set aside land for this purpose. Lodroe Nyima Rinpoche is supervising this project and has located the medical personnel that would train the nuns in both Chinese and Tibetan Medicine. The missing piece from this plan is the funding, and this is where we can help.

The nunnery has set a fund-raising goal of $150,000 to establish the Medical Center at the site of Thrangu Kong Jo Sherab Ling Nunnery. The funds would be used to build a hospital with electricity and running water, buy supplies, and train 10 nuns initially as medical providers.

**_We want to stress that this project will both provide critical medical care for rural Tibetans in an isolated community as well as creating a source of income for impoverished nuns. Please support this noble cause by writing a check._**

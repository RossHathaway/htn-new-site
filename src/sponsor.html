                            1. Food – Nuns at the monastery are nourished by the
                            generosity of the townspeople. However, the influx
                            of converting nuns to the monastery is creating a
                            shortage of food. Currently over 100 nuns are
                            relying on butter, cheese, and the slim donations
                            they receive through begging.

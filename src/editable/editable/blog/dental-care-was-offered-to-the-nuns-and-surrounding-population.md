This past June 2014 a dentist from Oregon, Hanna Karlin, was traveling in the area of the nunnery. And knowing this we bought a portable dental unit and shipped it there for her to use and at the same time teach a few nuns how to use. Hanna saw up to 10 patients a day for the three weeks she was there. During this time she tutored 3 nuns to do basic dental care.

    HTN has entered a growth period, and part of that growth is standardizing
    institutional procedures and enlarging its Board of Trustees, to better
    balance the various tasks that come with fundraising, publicity, and
    philanthropy. Three Board members – founder Amy McCracken, Lama Karma
    Drodhul, and Palma Puzzuoli – continue to serve. This spring, Amy Schwartz
    retired from the Board, and three new members accepted our request to serve.
    Our new board members include Jess McNally, Miriam Weber and Yan Zhao Ciupak
    (aka. Karma Dawa).

    Jess McNally: Jess grew up in Alberta, Canada, and attended Stanford
    University where she rowed in the Crew program and received her Bachelor’s
    and Master’s of Science degrees in Earth Systems. She began practicing in
    the Zen Buddhist tradition in 2009, and lived for three years at Zen
    Mountain Monastery in New York State before finding her way to Tibetan
    Buddhism. She took vows as a novice nun from Thrangu Rinpoche at Thrangu
    Monastery in Yushu, Qinghai in 2015. She met and made friends with some of
    the Thrangu nuns, did a lengthy solo meditation retreat in a cave high up in
    the Himalayas, and spent the better part of three years upholding the
    monastic vows. Currently Jess is a Facilitator with Tergar, the organization
    led by meditation master Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. She owns and operates an
    organic tea business called Natur’el Tea in Banff National Park, Canada. She
    also works as web design and marketing consultant. She enjoys skiing,
    biking, and the outdoor life with her puppy, Pema. Jess brings a range of
    skills and talents to the Board. Thank you for your service, Jess!

    Miriam Weber: Miriam is from Maryland, near Washington DC, and moved to
    California in the early 1990s to do postgraduate studies at UCDavis. She
    stayed in California, and began a 20 year teaching career with California
    State University at Monterey Bay. Miriam met the Dharma in 2000 and began
    attending teachings. Recently, she and her husband moved to Cape Cod where
    she met Amy McCracken and began attending the KKSG study group affiliated
    with KTD monastery. In the fall of 2019, Miriam was fortunate to go on
    Pilgrimage to visit several major Buddhist sites in Nepal and India. There
    she visited two nunneries and saw firsthand how devoted the nuns are in
    their studies and service. Thank you and welcome, Miriam!

    Yan Zhao Ciupak (Dharma name: Karma Dawa): Yan is an Associate Professor of
    Sociology at Northern Michigan University. With a strong desire to relieve
    suffering, she also received training and certification as a Grief Support
    Specialist and advocate for inclusive bereavement policies and
    compassion-based end-of-life care. Yan grew up at the base of Mount Wutai,
    one of China's four sacred mountains, which is associated with Manjushri,
    the buddha of wisdom. She witnessed a steady stream of pilgrims on the
    mountain during her childhood: lamas and practitioners, some doing full
    prostrations up the mountain. Yan came to the US in 2003 to pursue doctoral
    studies in the Sociology of Education. She explored many wisdom traditions
    but committed fully to Tibetan Buddhism when she met His Holiness Karmapa in
    2018 and took refuge with him. She has been conducting research and giving
    presentations to raise cultural awareness about authentic Tibetan Buddhist
    perspectives on living, dying, and being. Yan actively assists lamas and
    dharma teachers at KTD in Woodstock, NY. Yan has wanted to help nuns for
    many years now and is thrilled to offer her many gifts to the Board. Thank
    you so much, Yan!

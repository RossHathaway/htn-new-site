                In the summer of 2011, Amy McCracken visited Thrangu Kong Jo Sherab Ling Nunnery, in
                Eastern Tibet
                and was profoundly affected by the strong character of the nuns and their commitment to
                dharma
                practice and to the community. She saw that despite being very poor and begging for
                their sustenance
                in harsh conditions, the nuns have carved out a very meaningful spiritual existence on
                the isolated
                Tibetan plateau in Yushu, Qinghai Province, near the town of Jiegu, which was hit by a
                major
                earthquake in 2010. Amy was amazed by how rural the location of the nunnery was--none of
                them had
                ever met a person from North America before! When Amy returned to the U.S., she created
                HelpTibetanNuns.org to fulfill the nun's vision of a new medical center near the site of
                their
                nunnery in Tibet.

                        Help Tibetan Nuns was founded and began to raise funds for a medical center in
                        Tibet.

                        We donated $150,000 for the expansion and construction of naturally occurring
                        spring-fed
                        healing pools at Thrangu Nunnery in Tibet. Very popular with the locals, the
                        Olympic-sized pool is a source of income for the nunnery.

                        We gifted $50,000 to five Himalayan nunneries for education, medicine, and

                        We donated $20,000 to Palchen Choling Nunnery in Sikkim for the initial construction
                        costs for dormitories, kitchen, dining halls, classrooms, and a shrine.

                        We also were introduced to Tilokpur Nunnery in Dharmsala, India, the first nunnery
                        ever
                        built outside of Tibet. We began to support their construction project for a new
                        facility.

                        We raised $25,000 to help purchase a safe bus to transport the nuns from Thrangu
                        Nunnery
                        on the treacherous mountainous roads in Yushu, Tibet.

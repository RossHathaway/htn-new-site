We are so excited to have the opportunity to go back to where this project started. The trip will provide time to discuss the details of the medical center and move forward with the first phase of plans to build.

We are traveling with Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche and a large group, to celebrate the opening of the new Monastery, which has had to be rebuilt after the devastating earthquake of 2010.

Watch this space for further reports on the Medical Center after August!

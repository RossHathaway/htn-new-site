Last weekend, while at Karme Ling Retreat in New York, Lodroe Nyima Rinpoche gave an update on the Medical Center Project in Tibet. One of the things he mentioned is that now the nunnery has electricity and running water. This is a big improvement from 2011 when Amy McCracken was last there, visiting the nuns. Plans for the Medical Center are taking shape. Stay tuned for the full interview to be posted here soon.
